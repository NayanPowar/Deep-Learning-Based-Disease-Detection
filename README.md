#  Deep-Learning-Based-Disease-Detection


# This project uses a deep learning model (VGG16-based CNN) to classify skin disease images into psoriasis, acne, or eczema.
# It includes preprocessing, feature extraction, and regularized training for accurate and robust diagnosis. 
# The system is designed to assist dermatologists and improve access to skin disease detection, especially in resource-limited areas.
